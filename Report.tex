\begin{document}


\begin{overview}
This is the overview. 
The word \textbf{Overview} appears in the contentspage at \verb=\contentspage= as an unnumbered entry.
The gap between the overview heading and the overview text should be the same as in regular chapters. 
Set over two columns, the first and last baseline of the text in each column have the same vertical positions.

(But only if the overview is large enough!
If the text is too brief, the algorithm might prefer some other arrangement.
This is unlikely.) 

The first line of the overview starts at a fixed vertical position but the height of the text is determined by the constraint of matching the baselines.
In particular if the overview is too large, it will overflow the page.

Footnotes are not permitted in the overview.

Note that neither \LaTeX{} nor any other checks will stop or even warn you if the overview text overflows the bottom margin.
This is probably something that I could do, but it's not really my fault if you're that inattentive\dots . 
\end{overview}

\recommendation{Recommendation}\label{rec:use-labels}

\contentspage

\chapter{Chapter title}\label{chap:example}
This demonstrates the markup commands for sectioning. 
If you want to cross-reference a chapter/section/\etc\ later, you need to add a label, as on the line two lines (in the source) above this, and throughout.
Although \LaTeX{} doesn't require it, every label must have a specific prefix followed by a colon, as throughout this document.
Furthermore, every chapter must be labelled, even if it is never referenced.

To refer to a chapter, use \Chapref{chap:example}, % not \Vref{chap:example}, 
otherwise the hyperlink points to the baseline of the first text of the chapter, rather than the chapter title.
To refer to a chapter range, \Chaprefrange{chap:example}{chap:citations}.

Hugh forgot that you want to use the word `appendix', not `chapter' when referring to a chapter-level heading in the appendix.
If you can see this text, that bug should be fixed.
Thanks to Carmela for filing. 
For a bit more information about appendices, see \Chapref{chap:appendices} on \vpageref{chap:appendices}. 

(Do you see what we did there?
Sometimes you might want to refer something on a page not connected to a heading or caption,\footnote{Known generally as `counters'.} such as a paragraph in the middle of a section.
To do so, you have to mark the location with a `phantom section', as demonstrated in \Vref{paragraph:sentence-ending-periods}.
Note that the hyperlink with the cross-reference points to the location of the paragraph, not merely to the whole page.
To mention the page number, we say \vpageref{paragraph:sentence-ending-periods}.
This command is safe in one important respect: it will expand to `on this page', if the locations converge on the same page, so that the page number's appearance is never jarring.)

\begin{bigbox*}{Big box title}{box:big-example}
Far far away, behind the word mountains, far from the countries Snoot and Boot, there live the blind texts.
Separated they live in Bookmarks grove right at the coast of the Semantics, a large language ocean.

A small river named Carlton flows by their place and supplies it with the necessary regalia.
It is a paradise country, in which roasted parts of sentences fly into your mouth.

Even the all-powerful pointing has no control about the blind texts it is an almost non-orthographic life One day however a small line of blind text by the name of  decided to leave for the far World of Grammar.

The Big Ox advised her not to do so, because there were thousands of bad Commas, wild Question Marks and devious Semi, but the Little Blind Text didn't listen.
She packed her seven verse, put her initial into the belt and made herself on the way.

When she reached the first hills of the Italic Mountains, she had a last view back on the skyline of her home-town Bookmarks grove, the headline of Alphabet Village and the sub-line of her own road, the Line Lane.
Pitiful a rhetoric question ran over her cheek, then she continued her way.

On her way she met a copy.
The copy warned the Little Blind Text, that where it came from it would have been rewritten a thousand times and everything that was left from its origin would be the word ``and" and the Little Blind Text should turn around and return to its own, safe country.
But nothing the copy said could convince her and so it didn't take long until a few insidious Copy Writers ambushed her, made her drunk with Long Tongue and Parole and dragged her into their agency, where they abused her for their pleasure.

In addition to personal costs, obese people, on average, receive more healthcare than other people, with taxpayers funding most of the costs of those services.
Obese people also have lower rates of employment, receive more social services payments, and contribute less income tax than people in the normal weight range.
Together, this foregone tax and additional health and welfare expenses mean that taxpayers are about \$5.3~billion worse off each year. 

This report calls for a tax on sugar-sweetened beverages.
We recommend an excise tax of 40 cents per 100 grams of sugar on non-alcoholic, water-based beverages that contain added sugar.
This will increase the price of a two-litre bottle of soft drink by about 80 cents.
This tax would raise about \$500~million a year, generate a drop of about 15 per cent in consumption of SSBs and likely result in a small decrease in obesity rates, as people switch to water and other drinks not subject to the tax.

Between 2011 and 2016, half of all jobs growth was  within the city centres and inner suburbs in both Melbourne and Sydney.%
	\footnote{Melbourne residents in suburbs more than 20 kilometres from the CBD have fewer than three jobs nearby for every 10 residents, while those close to the city centre have access to nine jobs for every 10 residents, \citetitle{KellyDonegan2015-City-limits}.}
Knowledge-intensive businesses -- which tend to be the most productive, and which are growing fastest -- particularly benefit from clustering together in the centres of large cities.%

\begin{quote}
One of the reasons that clinicians struggle to form partnerships with patients and consumers is that there is inadequate information for proper informed consent.
The numbers that are collected don't filter through to clinicians dealing with the patient, and certainly not to the patient themselves.
I encourage people to ask doctors three questions: `What are my options?', `What are the treatment outcomes -- both benefits and risks?', and `How likely are those outcomes to happen to me?'.
Doctors though say `We just don't have that information'.
