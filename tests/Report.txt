In addition to personal costs, obese people, on average, receive more
healthcare than other people, with taxpayers funding most of the costs
of those services. Obese people also have lower rates of employment,
receive more social services payments, and contribute less income tax
than people in the normal weight range. Together, this foregone tax and
additional health and welfare expenses mean that taxpayers are about
$5.3 billion worse off each year.

This report calls for a tax on sugar-sweetened beverages. We
recommend an excise tax of 40 cents per 100 grams of sugar on
non-alcoholic, water-based beverages that contain added sugar. This
will increase the price of a two-litre bottle of soft drink by about 80
cents. This tax would raise about $500 million a year, generate a drop
of about 15 per cent in consumption of SSBs and likely result in a small
decrease in obesity rates, as people switch to water and other drinks
not subject to the tax.
